# 26-2-25-Inspiring-the-Next-Generation

Welcome to our first event for 2025!

How do we spark curiosity in coding, data science, and epidemiology among high school students? For the last several years, R-Ladies Melbourne has been running an engaging and interactive 80-minute workshop at the It Takes A Spark STEM Education Conference, introducing students to R, data visualisation, the power of clear science communication and concepts in epidemiology.

In this talk, Dionne will share insights from our experience delivering this workshopâ€”how we designed it, the challenges we navigated, and the impact we've seen. Weâ€™ll also discuss key lessons learned, how we've adapted our approach, and our vision for the future of inspiring young minds in STEM.

Whether youâ€™re an educator, mentor, or simply passionate about making STEM more accessible, join us to explore how we can continue to empower the next generation of data scientists and communicators.

See you there,
R-Ladies Melbourne ðŸ’œ
